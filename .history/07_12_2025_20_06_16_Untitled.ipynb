    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project sought to investigate the effectiveness of simple demographic data like **age** and **self-reported experience level** as the predictors of players who subscribed/haven't subscribed to the newsletter. The experiment was performed on the filtered data set taken from `players.csv` by training and testing a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier that was set to the value of **k = 9**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model was able to realize **an accuracy of 0.7347**, implying that it was able to correctly classify nearly 73% of players in the test set. Given that this model only used two features, this is reasonably accurate. However, to rely on accuracy alone isn't a way to classify performance. This is where we turn towards the precision and recall scores for the positive class (subscribed). The model appeared to have a **recall of 0.9722**, so it sorted out almost all true subscribers with great success. This means the model very rarely makes a mistake in missing someone who actually subscribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the **precision score was 0.7447**, meaning that when the model predicts a user as a subscriber, it is right only 74% of the time. The recall-precision gap is somewhat large, so the classifier often **overpredicts** the positive class, labeling some non-subscribers as subscribers. This tendency is actually aligned with the results of the exploratory data analysis we did earlier: neither age nor experience exhibited a strong distinction between the two groups. Age distributions were skewed, and the experience categories were overlapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "From our findings, **age and experience are not good predictors** of whether someone will want to subscribe to the newsletter. Though the model is very sensitive in detecting actual subscribers, it isn't specific enough to be a reliable classifier of subcription status. It really shows how demographic variables alone do not really determine subscription behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model's prediction in the future, more features should be added, especially behavioral ones such as **`hours_played`, cumulative hours, and session-level patterns**—all of which can be found in `sessions.csv` or derived from it. These characteristics are more directly connected to engagement hence they are more likely to unveil the pattern difference between subscribers and non-subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be brief, the findings indicate that **age and experience are not strong standalone predictors** of people signing up for a newsletter. They help the model find almost all the subscribers, but they do not give the correct discriminatory power for accurate classification. Integrating valuable consumer behavior and session data to create a more effective player-engagement prediction system would yield much better results in future models.\n"
